\vspace*{4\baselineskip}
When I graduated from high school, the event that mattered most to me was 
not walking across the stage at commencement, but rather the end-of-year 
debate team dinner and awards ceremony. The group of people that had been
my friends on the debate team made my experience much more memorable and 
gave me a connection to the school that I would not otherwise have had.
While I have lost touch with many of the people I knew at the time, I am 
still very close friends with my friends from debate. Andrew, Chris D.,
Chris V., Chris K., Lucas, and the rest of our group of friends have 
what we have in large part because of that activity, and that is what 
really made my educational activities complete.

In the same way, while I have been honored to have the opportunity to 
earn a doctorate from Stony Brook University, what really has made my 
time here special is the group of people I regularly interacted with 
on the astronomy floor. My advisor, Mike Zingale, is of course brilliant 
and someone who has a talent level that causes me to aspire to reach 
even a small fraction of that level. But I did not come to Stony Brook for 
that reason; there are smart and talented people everywhere. I came here 
because Mike inspires me to do better and constantly challenge myself,
and because he shares many of my values about what makes good science and 
how good software development for scientific computing should be done,
but most importantly because he has the necessary sense of humor to work 
with me.
